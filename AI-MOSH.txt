AI-MOSH
- What Large Language Models (LLM) are
- What we can do with them
- How to use them effectively
- Practical concepts: tokens, cost, model selection, etc


- AI engineer is not the same as a machine learning engineer.
- Machine learning engineers build and train model, they clean data, tune architectures, and optimize training pipelines.
    It's math - heavy and research - focused.
- AI engineers, on the other hand, use pre-trained models, especially LLM, to build smarter applications.
The don't need to understand the maths behind the model, the need to understand how to use it and how to integrate it into real world apps.

SUMMARIZATION, TRANSLATION, INTELLIGENCE SEARCH, AUTOMATION, AND PERSONALIZED UX.


ESSENTIAL AI SKILLS
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt Engineering
- Retrieveal- Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector Databases
- Building Agents


What is a LLM
A system that's trained to understand and gnerate human Language
Training matters a lot
